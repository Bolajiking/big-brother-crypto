# Big Brother Crypto MVP Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a complete end-to-end MVP for "Big Brother Crypto" - a live streaming platform with multiple concurrent camera feeds, main player, live chat, and fishtank.live-inspired UI. The project uses Next.js, Livepeer for video, and socket.io for real-time chat functionality.

**NEW REQUEST**: Integrate Privy authentication system to replace the current localStorage-based authentication. Privy will provide Web3 wallet authentication capabilities and better user management.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Setting up Next.js project with proper structure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Integrating Livepeer for video streaming ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Implementing real-time chat with socket.io ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Creating fishtank.live-inspired UI with dark theme and monospace fonts ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Managing multiple camera feeds with grid layout ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Authentication system with localStorage ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**NEW CHALLENGES FOR PRIVY INTEGRATION**:
- Replace localStorage-based auth with Privy Web3 authentication
- Install and configure Privy SDK
- Update AuthContext to use Privy hooks and methods
- Modify login/logout flow to work with Privy
- Ensure compatibility with existing components
- Handle Web3 wallet connection states
- Update user interface to support wallet authentication

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**EXECUTOR MODE - DEPLOYMENT ISSUE IDENTIFIED** üö®

**DEPLOYMENT FAILURE DUE TO DEPENDENCY CONFLICTS**:
- ‚ùå npm install failing during deployment
- ‚ùå Conflicting peer dependency: `@solana-program/system@0.8.1` vs `^0.9.0`
- ‚ùå `@privy-io/react-auth@3.4.0` expects `@solana-program/system@^0.8.0`
- ‚ùå Current package.json has `@solana-program/system@^0.9.0`

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**:
The deployment is failing because of version conflicts between Solana packages. Need to:

1. **Fix dependency versions**: Downgrade `@solana-program/system` to `^0.8.0` to match Privy requirements
2. **Check other Solana packages**: Ensure all Solana packages are compatible
3. **Test deployment**: Verify the fix resolves the npm install errors
4. **Update package-lock.json**: Ensure clean dependency resolution

**REQUEST FOR PLANNER APPROVAL**:
Should I proceed with fixing the dependency conflicts to resolve the deployment issues?

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
- Socket.io requires a custom server setup for Next.js
- HLS.js provides better video streaming support than native video elements
