# Big Brother Crypto MVP Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a complete end-to-end MVP for "Big Brother Crypto" - a live streaming platform with multiple concurrent camera feeds, main player, live chat, and fishtank.live-inspired UI. The project uses Next.js, Livepeer for video, and socket.io for real-time chat functionality.

**NEW REQUEST**: Integrate Privy authentication system to replace the current localStorage-based authentication. Privy will provide Web3 wallet authentication capabilities and better user management.

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**EXECUTOR MODE - MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED** âœ…

**PRIVY INTEGRATION IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**:
- âœ… Privy SDK installed (`@privy-io/react-auth`)
- âœ… Privy configuration created (`src/lib/privy.tsx`)
- âœ… PrivyProvider configured in app layout
- âœ… AuthContext completely migrated to use Privy hooks
- âœ… Login page redesigned for wallet authentication
- âœ… User interface updated to display wallet address
- âœ… All linting errors resolved

**READY FOR TESTING**:
The Privy integration is now complete and ready for testing. To test:

1. **Set up environment variable**: Create `.env.local` with your Privy App ID
2. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
3. **Test wallet connection**: Visit `/login` and test wallet connection
4. **Verify user display**: Check that wallet address displays correctly in profile dropdown

**NEXT STEPS**: 
- Test the authentication flow manually
- Clean up old authentication API routes
- Verify all existing functionality still works

## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
- Socket.io requires a custom server setup for Next.js
- HLS.js provides better video streaming support than native video elements
