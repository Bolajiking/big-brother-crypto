## Lessons
- Include info useful for debugging in the program output
- Read the file before trying to edit it
- If vulnerabilities appear in terminal, run npm audit before proceeding
- Always ask before using -force git command
- Socket.io requires a custom server setup for Next.js
- HLS.js provides better video streaming support than native video elements
